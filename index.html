<h1 id="anxiety-management-workbook">Introduction</h1>
<p>Stress, worry and anxiety can have an enormous impact on all aspects of your life. It caninterfere with your sleep, cause irritability, make it difficult to think clearly or make good decisions. It can cause muscle tension, headaches, diarrhea and other physical problems, leaving you drained and unable to move forward in important areas of your life. Stress and anxiety can also cause problems in your significant relationships and make it difficult to relax and enjoy what you are doing. I have found that utilizing a set of tools to effectively appraise your stressors and sources of anxiety and then apply effective coping strategies makes it possible to live life with less distress and greater joy.</p>

<p>In this book, I will go over each of the skills I have found to be most useful in helping people live more freely and reach their goals. Many of them you have heard about already. They get talked about in yoga classes, on TV shows and wellness blogs. Some of them appear in 12-step programs as well. My intent is to present these tools in a way that is easy to understand, gives some insight into the science and research behind them, and offers a variety of exercises to help you learn and practice the skills so they will become a part of your day-to-day life. Some will feel more natural than others. Some you may already being doing, while others may feel really challenging. The key is to do the best you can and keep practicing. Eventually, many of them will become routine. Others may need continued practice and reminders.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-cope-with-stress">How we cope with stress</h2>
<p>Stress is part of life and in fact can help us recognize potential areas of concern, or can even be a motivator.  However when we experience stress or distressing emotions, most of us have a tendency to either: avoid them, react impulsively or get paralyzed. I like to refer to this as also as a flight, fight or freeze response. Effectively coping involves working through these feelings and assessing and determining the best way to deal with the stressor rather than being reactive.</p>

<h2 id="importance-of-building-capacity-for-positive-affect">Importance of building capacity for positive affect</h2>
<p>We tend to be really good at retaining our mistakes and missteps, or any of our experiences that didn’t go as well as we’d hoped, but, when it comes to remembering the better moments, we’re not as skilled. Its like we have a filter that catches all the negative, and little of the positive. The exciting news is that, with practice, we can start to retrain our mind to give equal billing to the good moments and positive things in our lives. This doesn’t mean denying that there are difficult and upsetting experiences or pretending that struggles aren’t real. It’s about creating balance.</p>

<p>Positive thinking can also help us successfully change unhealthy behaviors and move out of being stuck.</p>

 <p class="top">I became particularly aware of this my first year of graduate school. I was a heavy smoker for years. I decided that it was finally time to quit. It was really tough at first and success was starting to feel hopeless.</p> 

<p>My advisor at the time was also a heavy smoker, to the point where she had that deep raspy voice many long term smokers eventually acquire. During our monthly meeting she asked me how things were going. I responded, “to tell you the truth, its been kind of tough lately, I am trying to stop smoking and though I have been able to make it a week or two at a time, I inevitably break down when out with friends or under the stress of writing a paper. I’m feeling really bad about it.”</p>

<p>She said, in her deep cracking voice, “David, it’s not about the times you gave in and had one. What is important are the days you managed not to smoke, because, each of those cigarettes you didn’t have, will be one less cigarette you smoke and no one can take that away from you.”   I remember in that moment, my whole outlook changed. I no longer felt like I was failing, instead I was suddenly able to see my successes. I stopped focusing on when I broke down but on the periods when I wasn’t smoking.</p>  

<p>Each time I made it a little longer, a week, a month, an entire summer, without lighting up. I felt more confident I could do this. I countered whatever post-nicotine relapse negative thoughts were emerging, with her raspy voice, reminding me that all was not lost and that it was just a small setback on the road to success. The periods between smokes continued to stretch out until the idea of lighting up became hard to imagine.</p>

<p>There is a lot of talk about mindfulness these days. It seems like it is popping up as the solution to everything. While it may not be the magical cure to all, there is a growing body of research showing that increased mindfulness helps us to better see and connect with positive feelings and experiences, allowing us to live happier lives. Mindfulness has also been found to help people be less reactive and more responsive and intentional when experiencing anxiety or stress, allowing for less intense responses and better decision making.  (Add John Cabot-Zinn UMass studies on anxiety, depression and mindfulness) Mindfulness practices are integrated throughout each chapter and detailed in Chapter 2.</p>
