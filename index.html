<div class="blurb">
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Stress, worry and anxiety can have an enormous impact on all aspects of your life. It caninterfere with your sleep, cause irritability, make it difficult to think clearly or make good decisions. It can cause muscle tension, headaches, diarrhea and other physical problems, leaving you drained and unable to move forward in important areas of your life. Stress and anxiety can also cause problems in your significant relationships and make it difficult to relax and enjoy what you are doing. I have found that utilizing a set of tools to effectively appraise your stressors and sources of anxiety and then apply effective coping strategies makes it possible to live life with less distress and greater joy.</p>
<p>In this book, I will go over each of the skills I have found to be most useful in helping people live more freely and reach their goals. Many of them you have heard about already. They get talked about in yoga classes, on TV shows and wellness blogs. Some of them appear in 12-step programs as well. My intent is to present these tools in a way that is easy to understand, gives some insight into the science and research behind them, and offers a variety of exercises to help you learn and practice the skills so they will become a part of your day-to-day life. Some will feel more natural than others. Some you may already being doing, while others may feel really challenging. The key is to do the best you can and keep practicing. Eventually, many of them will become routine. Others may need continued practice and reminders.</p>
<h2>How we cope with stress</h2>
<p>Stress is part of life and in fact can help us recognize potential areas of concern, or can even be a motivator.  However when we experience stress or distressing emotions, most of us have a tendency to either: avoid them, react impulsively or get paralyzed. I like to refer to this as also as a flight, fight or freeze response. Effectively coping involves working through these feelings and assessing and determining the best way to deal with the stressor rather than being reactive.</p>
