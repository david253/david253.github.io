# Chapter 8: Harnessing your Strengths and Staying Connected to your Values 

## Strengths
You have a unique set of strengths, talents, skills, and positive qualities. These strengths have helped you get through challenges in the past. In times of stress, when we are really anxious or feeling depressed, it is really easy to lose sight of our own strengths.  You may have a great sense of humor, but haven’t felt very funny lately; you may be very creative, but haven’t had the time or opportunity to express that creativity.  

It is important to remember that your strengths are a part of you. Even if you haven’t made use of a given strength in a while, you still have that strength and you can call upon that strength to cope with whatever is going on with you.  Our strengths don’t go away, but we sometimes need to be reminded that those strengths are there.  

Remembering and recognizing your strengths has positive impact on your mood, and can help you even more than that:  Simply reminding yourself of your strengths can help you accomplish things that you want to do.  
Recognizing your own strengths and instances in which you have used or exercised these strengths can help you better cope with stressful things in your life.

Personal Values
Values can be understood as the very best of how we see ourselves. Values are a critical part of how we make important changes in our lives. It is easy to become out of touch with our values and sometimes we hold on to values that no longer accurately reflect who we are, or maybe were never our values to begin with, but someone else’s values we took on. 

Values are often very personal in that they reflect how you were raised, your family, the culture you grew up in, the experiences you have had in your life, and often the very best of who you hope to become.  

It is also helpful to know that your strengths are very much a part of your past experiences and values.  

For example, if one of your strengths is that you are a fair person, you might have an underlying value for justice.  The strength of being fair can be a way to live that value in action. 

Take a few moments to reflect on what values are important to you and list them below (If you are having trouble thinking of any, take a look at the values list on the next page) As you do this try to withhold judgment and pick the values that resonate with you, as apposed to the ones you believe you should have. 

Now take a look at the list and rank them in order of importance to you. Write your top 3 values down 

Our strengths often reflect or are tied to the values we hold.
